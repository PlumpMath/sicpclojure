# [About this project](about.html)

This is a version of the classic [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)
by Hal Abelson and Jerry &amp; Julie Sussman, revised with code examples in [Clojure](http://clojure.org) instead
of the original [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_\(programming_language\)).

The original text is licensed under a Creative Commons [BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
license (so this site is too). If you successfully complete all the exercises, 
[Peter Norvig](http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8) will send you a free wizard hat.

The [code samples](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/sicpclojure/tree/master/resources/code) and 
[chapter text](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/sicpclojure/tree/master/resources/text) are available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/sicpclojure), so you can contribute to the project yourself. If you see
an example that could be improved, want to add a footnote or aside about Clojure, or want to jump in and edit
one of the uncompleted chapters, please make a fix and submit a pull request. Guidelines for editing the source text
are posted [here](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/sicpclojure/blob/master/README.md). I'm a newcomer to Clojure (the 
static site generator that powers this site is my first real project), so I hope more experienced Clojurists will 
help out. I'll be posting chapters [bird by bird](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird) as I work
through SICP myself, so it might be a while before the whole book is finished.

Behind the scenes, this site uses [Requirejs](http://requirejs.org/), [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/),
[Highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/), [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts),
and the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) template, plus 
the [pegdown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown) markdown processor, [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)
templates, and the [Hickory](https://github.com/davidsantiago/hickory) HTML to Hiccup parser.
