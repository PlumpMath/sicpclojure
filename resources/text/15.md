## [2.2  Hierarchical Data and the Closure Property](contents.html#sec_2.2)

As we have seen, pairs provide a primitive "glue" that we can use to
construct compound data objects. Figure 2.2 shows a standard way to visualize
a pair -- in this case, the pair formed by `(list 1 2)`. In this
representation, which is called _box-and-pointer notation_, each object is
shown as a _pointer_ to a box. The box for a primitive object contains a
representation of the object. For example, the box for a number contains a
numeral. The box for a pair is actually a double box, the left part containing
(a pointer to) the `first` of the pair and the right part containing the `rest`.

We have already seen that `conj` can be used to combine not only numbers but
pairs as well. (You made use of this fact, or should have, in doing exercises
[2.2](14.html#_thm_2.2) and [2.3](14.html#_thm_2.3).) As a
consequence, pairs provide a universal building block from which we can
construct all sorts of data structures. Figure 2.3 shows two ways to use pairs
to combine the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Figure 2.2:**  Box-and-pointer representation of `(list 1 2)`.

**Figure 2.3:**  Two ways to combine 1, 2, 3, and 4 using pairs.

The ability to create pairs whose elements are pairs is the essence of list
structure's importance as a representational tool. We refer to this ability as
the _closure property_ of `conj`. In general, an operation for combining data
objects satisfies the closure property if the results of combining things with
that operation can themselves be combined using the same operation.[^fn-6] Closure
is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us to
create _hierarchical_ structures -- structures made up of parts, which
themselves are made up of parts, and so on.

From the outset of chapter 1, we've made essential use of closure in dealing
with procedures, because all but the very simplest programs rely on the fact
that the elements of a combination can themselves be combinations. In this
section, we take up the consequences of closure for compound data. We describe
some conventional techniques for using pairs to represent sequences and trees,
and we exhibit a graphics language that illustrates closure in a vivid way.[^fn-7]

### [2.2.1  Representing Sequences](contents.html#sec_2.2.1)

![](ch2-Z-G-13.gif)

**Figure 2.4:**  The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 represented as a chain of pairs.

One of the useful structures we can build with pairs is a _sequence_ \-- an
ordered collection of data objects. There are, of course, many ways to
represent sequences in terms of pairs. One particularly straightforward
representation is illustrated in figure 2.4, where the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 is
represented as a chain of pairs. The `first` of each pair is the corresponding
item in the chain, and the `rest` of the pair is the next pair in the chain.
The `rest` of the final pair signals the end of the sequence by pointing to a
distinguished value that is not a pair, represented in box-and-pointer
diagrams as a diagonal line and in programs as the empty list `()`. The entire
sequence is constructed by nested `cons` operations:

{{ 2.2.1.1.clj }}

Such a sequence of pairs, formed by nested `cons`es, is called a _list_, and
Clojure provides a primitive called `list` to help in constructing lists.[^fn-8] The
above sequence could be produced by `(list 1 2 3 4)`. In general,

{{ 2.2.1.2.clj }}

is equivalent to

{{ 2.2.1.3.clj }}

Lisp systems conventionally print lists by printing the sequence of elements,
enclosed in parentheses. Thus, the data object in figure 2.4 is printed as `(1
2 3 4)`:

{{ 2.2.1.4.clj }}

Be careful not to confuse the expression `(list 1 2 3 4)` with the list `(1 2
3 4)`, which is the result obtained when the expression is evaluated.
Attempting to evaluate the expression `(1 2 3 4)` will signal an error when
the interpreter tries to apply the procedure `1` to arguments `2`, `3`, and
`4`.

We can think of `first` as selecting the first item in the list, and of `rest` as
selecting the sublist consisting of all but the first item. Nested
applications of `first` and `rest` can be used to extract the second, third, and
subsequent items in the list.[^fn-9] The constructor `cons` makes a list like the
original one, but with an additional item at the beginning.

{{ 2.2.1.5.clj }}

The value of `()`, used to terminate the chain of pairs, can be thought of as
a sequence of no elements, the _empty list_. The `first` of an empty list
returns the special value `nil`. The word _nil_ is a contraction
of the Latin word _nihil_, which means "nothing."[^fn-10]

#### [List operations](contents.html#sec_Temp_159)

The use of pairs to represent sequences of elements as lists is accompanied by
conventional programming techniques for manipulating lists by successively
"`rest`ing down" the lists. For example, the procedure `nth` takes as
arguments a list and a number _n_ and returns the _n_th item of the list. It
is customary to number the elements of the list beginning with 0. The method
for computing `nth` is the following:

  * For _n_ = 0, `nth` should return the `first` of the list.

  * Otherwise, `nth` should return the (_n_ \- 1)st item of the `rest` of the list. 

{{ 2.2.1.6.clj }}

Often we `rest` down the whole list. To aid in this, Scheme includes a
primitive predicate `empty?`, which tests whether its argument is the empty
list. The procedure `count`, which returns the number of items in a list,
illustrates this typical pattern of use:

{{ 2.2.1.7.clj }}

The `count` procedure implements a simple recursive plan. The reduction step
is:

  * The `count` of any list is 1 plus the `count` of the `rest` of the list. 

This is applied successively until we reach the base case:

  * The `count` of the empty list is 0. 

We could also compute `count` in an iterative style:

{{ 2.2.1.8.clj }}

Another conventional programming technique is to "`cons` up" an answer list
while `rest`ing down a list, as in the procedure `concat`, which takes two
lists as arguments and combines their elements to make a new list:

{{ 2.2.1.9.clj }}

`Concat` is also implemented using a recursive plan. To `concat` lists `list1`
and `list2`, do the following:

  * If `list1` is the empty list, then the result is just `list2`.

  * Otherwise, `concat` the `rest` of `list1` and `list2`, and `cons` the `first` 
  of `list1` onto the result: 

{{ 2.2.1.10.clj }}

**Exercise 2.17.**  Define a procedure `last-list` that returns the list that 
contains only the last element of a given (nonempty) list:

{{ 2.2.1.11.clj }}

**Exercise 2.18.**  Define a procedure `reverse` that takes a list as argument and
returns a list of the same elements in reverse order:

{{ 2.2.1.12.clj }}

**Exercise 2.19.**  Consider the change-counting program of section 
[1.2.2](11.html#sec_1.2.2). It would be nice to be able to easily change the currency
used by the program, so that we could compute the number of ways to change a British
pound, for example. As the program is written, the knowledge of the currency is
distributed partly into the procedure `first-denomination` and partly into the 
procedure `count-change` (which knows that there are five kinds of U.S. coins). It 
would be nicer to be able to supply a list of coins to be used for making change.

We want to rewrite the procedure `cc` so that its second argument is a list of
the values of the coins to use rather than an integer specifying which coins
to use. We could then have lists that defined each kind of currency:

{{ 2.2.1.13.clj }}

We could then call `cc` as follows:

{{ 2.2.1.14.clj }}

To do this will require changing the program `cc` somewhat. It will still have
the same form, but it will access its second argument differently, as follows:

{{ 2.2.1.15.clj }}

Define the procedures `first-denomination`, `except-first-denomination`, and
`no-more?` in terms of primitive operations on list structures. Does the order
of the list `coin-values` affect the answer produced by `cc`? Why or why not?

**Exercise 2.20.**  The procedures `+`, `*`, and `list` take arbitrary numbers 
of arguments. One way to define such procedures is to use `defn` with 
_var args_. In a procedure definition, a parameter list that has an ampersand
before the last parameter name indicates that, when the procedure is called, the
initial parameters (if any) will have as values the initial arguments, as usual,
but the final parameter's value will be a _list_ of any remaining arguments. For 
instance, given the definition 

{{ 2.2.1.16.clj }}

the procedure `f` can be called with two or more arguments. If we evaluate

{{ 2.2.1.17.clj }}

then in the body of `f`, `x` will be 1, `y` will be 2, and `z` will be the
list `(3 4 5 6)`. Given the definition

{{ 2.2.1.18.clj }}

the procedure `g` can be called with zero or more arguments. If we evaluate

{{ 2.2.1.19.clj }}

then in the body of `g`, `w` will be the list `(1 2 3 4 5 6)`.[^fn-11]

Use this notation to write a procedure `same-parity` that takes one or more
integers and returns a list of all the arguments that have the same even-odd
parity as the first argument. For example,

{{ 2.2.1.20.clj }}

#### [Mapping over lists](contents.html#sec_Temp_165)

One extremely useful operation is to apply some transformation to each element
in a list and generate the list of results. For instance, the following
procedure scales each number in a list by a given factor:

{{ 2.2.1.21.clj }}

We can abstract this general idea and capture it as a common pattern expressed
as a higher-order procedure, just as in section
[1.3](12.html#sec_1.3). The higher-order procedure here is called
`map`. `Map` takes as arguments a procedure of one argument and a list, and
returns a list of the results produced by applying the procedure to each
element in the list:[^fn-12]

{{ 2.2.1.22.clj }}

Now we can give a new definition of `scale-list` in terms of `map`:

{{ 2.2.1.23.clj }}

`Map` is an important construct, not only because it captures a common
pattern, but because it establishes a higher level of abstraction in dealing
with lists. In the original definition of `scale-list`, the recursive
structure of the program draws attention to the element-by-element processing
of the list. Defining `scale-list` in terms of `map` suppresses that level of
detail and emphasizes that scaling transforms a list of elements to a list of
results. The difference between the two definitions is not that the computer
is performing a different process (it isn't) but that we think about the
process differently. In effect, `map` helps establish an abstraction barrier
that isolates the implementation of procedures that transform lists from the
details of how the elements of the list are extracted and combined. Like the
barriers shown in figure [2.1](14.html#fig_2.1), this abstraction
gives us the flexibility to change the low-level details of how sequences are
implemented, while preserving the conceptual framework of operations that
transform sequences to sequences. Section 2.2.3 expands on this use of
sequences as a framework for organizing programs.

**Exercise 2.21.**  The procedure `square-list` takes a list of numbers as argument and returns a list of the squares of those numbers.

{{ 2.2.1.24.clj }}

Here are two different definitions of `square-list`. Complete both of them by
filling in the missing expressions:

{{ 2.2.1.25.clj }}

**Exercise 2.22.**  Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first `square-list` procedure of exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:

{{ 2.2.1.26.clj }}

Unfortunately, defining `square-list` this way produces the answer list in the
reverse order of the one desired. Why?

Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to `cons`:

{{ 2.2.1.27.clj }}

This doesn't work either. Explain.

**Exercise 2.23.**  The procedure `doseq` is similar to `map`. It takes as arguments
a procedure and a list of elements. However, rather than forming a list of the results,
`doseq` just applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from left to 
right. The values returned by applying the procedure to the elements are not used at all 
-- `doseq` is used with procedures that perform an action, such as printing. For 
example, 

{{ 2.2.1.28.clj }}

The value returned by the call to `doseq` (not illustrated above) is always `nil`.

### [2.2.2  Hierarchical Structures](contents.html#sec_2.2.2)

The representation of sequences in terms of lists generalizes naturally to
represent sequences whose elements may themselves be sequences. For example,
we can regard the object `((1 2) 3 4)` constructed by

{{ 2.2.2.1.clj }}

as a list of three items, the first of which is itself a list, `(1 2)`.
Indeed, this is suggested by the form in which the result is printed by the
interpreter. Figure 2.5 shows the representation of this structure in terms of
pairs.

![](ch2-Z-G-15.gif)

**Figure 2.5:**  Structure formed by `(cons (list 1 2) (list 3 4))`.

Another way to think of sequences whose elements are sequences is as _trees_.
The elements of the sequence are the branches of the tree, and elements that
are themselves sequences are subtrees. Figure 2.6 shows the structure in
figure 2.5 viewed as a tree.

![](ch2-Z-G-16.gif)

**Figure 2.6:**  The list structure in figure 2.5 viewed as a tree.

Recursion is a natural tool for dealing with tree structures, since we can
often reduce operations on trees to operations on their branches, which reduce
in turn to operations on the branches of the branches, and so on, until we
reach the leaves of the tree. As an example, compare the `count` procedure of
section 2.2.1 with the `count-leaves` procedure, which returns the total
number of leaves of a tree:

{{ 2.2.2.2.clj }}

To implement `count-leaves`, recall the recursive plan for computing `count`:

  * `Count` of a list `x` is 1 plus `count` of the `cdr` of `x`.

  * `Count` of the empty list is 0. 

`Count-leaves` is similar. The value for the empty list is the same:

  * `Count-leaves` of the empty list is 0. 

But in the reduction step, where we strip off the `first` of the list, we must
take into account that the `first` may itself be a tree whose leaves we need to
count. Thus, the appropriate reduction step is

  * `Count-leaves` of a tree `x` is `count-leaves` of the `first` of `x` plus
    `count-leaves` of the `rest` of `x`. 

Finally, by taking `first`s we reach actual leaves, so we need another base
case:

  * `Count-leaves` of a leaf is 1. 

To aid in writing recursive procedures on trees, Scheme provides the primitive
predicate `seq?`, which tests whether its argument is a sequence. Here is the
complete procedure:[^fn13]

{{ 2.2.2.3.clj }}

**Exercise 2.24.**  Suppose we evaluate the expression `(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))`.
Give the result printed by the interpreter, the corresponding box-and-pointer 
structure, and the interpretation of this as a tree (as in figure 2.6). 

**Exercise 2.25.**  Give combinations of `first`s and `rest`s that will pick 7 from each
of the following lists:

{{ 2.2.2.4.clj }}

**Exercise 2.26.**  Suppose we define `x` and `y` to be two lists:

{{ 2.2.2.5.clj }}

What result is printed by the interpreter in response to evaluating each of
the following expressions:

{{ 2.2.2.6.clj }}

**Exercise 2.27.**  Modify your `reverse` procedure of exercise 2.18 to produce a
`deep-reverse` procedure that takes a list as argument and returns as its value the 
list with its elements reversed and with all sublists deep-reversed as well. For 
example,

{{ 2.2.2.7.clj }}

**Exercise 2.28.**  Write a procedure `fringe` that takes as argument a tree 
(represented as a list) and returns a list whose elements are all the leaves of the
tree arranged in left-to-right order. For example,

{{ 2.2.2.8.clj }}

**Exercise 2.29.**  A binary mobile consists of two branches, a left branch and a 
right branch. Each branch is a rod of a certain length, from which hangs either a 
weight or another binary mobile. We can represent a binary mobile using compound data
 by constructing it from two branches (for example, using `list`):

{{ 2.2.2.9.clj }}

A branch is constructed from a `length` (which must be a number) together with
a `structure`, which may be either a number (representing a simple weight) or
another mobile:

{{ 2.2.2.10.clj }}

a.  Write the corresponding selectors `left-branch` and `right-branch`, which
return the branches of a mobile, and `branch-length` and `branch-structure`,
which return the components of a branch.

b.  Using your selectors, define a procedure `total-weight` that returns the
total weight of a mobile.

c.  A mobile is said to be _balanced_ if the torque applied by its top-left
branch is equal to that applied by its top-right branch (that is, if the
length of the left rod multiplied by the weight hanging from that rod is equal
to the corresponding product for the right side) and if each of the submobiles
hanging off its branches is balanced. Design a predicate that tests whether a
binary mobile is balanced.

d.  Suppose we change the representation of mobiles so that the constructors
are

{{ 2.2.2.11.clj }}

How much do you need to change your programs to convert to the new
representation?

#### [Mapping over trees](contents.html#sec_Temp_177)

Just as `map` is a powerful abstraction for dealing with sequences, `map`
together with recursion is a powerful abstraction for dealing with trees. For
instance, the `scale-tree` procedure, analogous to `scale-list` of section
2.2.1, takes as arguments a numeric factor and a tree whose leaves are
numbers. It returns a tree of the same shape, where each number is multiplied
by the factor. The recursive plan for `scale-tree` is similar to the one for
`count-leaves`:

{{ 2.2.2.12.clj }}

Another way to implement `scale-tree` is to regard the tree as a sequence of
sub-trees and use `map`. We map over the sequence, scaling each sub-tree in
turn, and return the list of results. In the base case, where the tree is a
leaf, we simply multiply by the factor:

{{ 2.2.2.13.clj }}

Many tree operations can be implemented by similar combinations of sequence
operations and recursion.

**Exercise 2.30.**  Define a procedure `square-tree` analogous to the `square-list`
procedure of exercise 2.21. That is, `square-list` should behave as follows:

{{ 2.2.2.14.clj }}

Define `square-tree` both directly (i.e., without using any higher-order
procedures) and also by using `map` and recursion.

**Exercise 2.31.**  Abstract your answer to exercise 2.30 to produce a procedure
`tree-map` with the property that `square-tree` could be defined as

{{ 2.2.2.15.clj }}

**Exercise 2.32.**  We can represent a set as a list of distinct elements, and we can
represent the set of all subsets of the set as a list of lists. For example, if the set
is `(1 2 3)`, then the set of all subsets is 
`(() (3) (2) (2 3) (1) (1 3) (1 2) (1 2 3))`. Complete the following definition of a
procedure that generates the set of subsets of a set and give a clear explanation of
why it works: 

{{ 2.2.2.16.clj }}

### [2.2.3  Sequences as Conventional Interfaces](contents.html#sec_2.2.3)

In working with compound data, we've stressed how data abstraction permits us
to design programs without becoming enmeshed in the details of data
representations, and how abstraction preserves for us the flexibility to
experiment with alternative representations. In this section, we introduce
another powerful design principle for working with data structures -- the use
of _conventional interfaces_.

In section [1.3](12.html#sec_1.3) we saw how program abstractions,
implemented as higher-order procedures, can capture common patterns in
programs that deal with numerical data. Our ability to formulate analogous
operations for working with compound data depends crucially on the style in
which we manipulate our data structures. Consider, for example, the following
procedure, analogous to the `count-leaves` procedure of section 2.2.2, which
takes a tree as argument and computes the sum of the squares of the leaves
that are odd:

{{ 2.2.3.1.clj }}

On the surface, this procedure is very different from the following one, which
constructs a list of all the even Fibonacci numbers \\( Fib(k) \\), where _k_
is less than or equal to a given integer _n_:

{{ 2.2.3.2.clj }}

Despite the fact that these two procedures are structurally very different, a
more abstract description of the two computations reveals a great deal of
similarity. The first program

  * enumerates the leaves of a tree; 
  * filters them, selecting the odd ones; 
  * squares each of the selected ones; and 
  * accumulates the results using `+`, starting with 0. 

The second program

  * enumerates the integers from 0 to _n_; 
  * computes the Fibonacci number for each integer; 
  * filters them, selecting the even ones; and 
  * accumulates the results using `cons`, starting with the empty list. 

A signal-processing engineer would find it natural to conceptualize these
processes in terms of signals flowing through a cascade of stages, each of
which implements part of the program plan, as shown in figure 2.7. In `sum-
odd-squares`, we begin with an _enumerator_, which generates a "signal"
consisting of the leaves of a given tree. This signal is passed through a
_filter_, which eliminates all but the odd elements. The resulting signal is
in turn passed through a _map_, which is a "transducer" that applies the
`square` procedure to each element. The output of the map is then fed to an
_accumulator_, which combines the elements using `+`, starting from an initial
0. The plan for `even-fibs` is analogous.

![](ch2-Z-G-17.gif)

**Figure 2.7:**  The signal-flow plans for the procedures `sum-odd-squares` (top)
and `even-fibs` (bottom) reveal the commonality between the two programs.

Unfortunately, the two procedure definitions above fail to exhibit this
signal-flow structure. For instance, if we examine the `sum-odd-squares`
procedure, we find that the enumeration is implemented partly by the `empty?`
and `seq?` tests and partly by the tree-recursive structure of the procedure.
Similarly, the accumulation is found partly in the tests and partly in the
addition used in the recursion. In general, there are no distinct parts of
either procedure that correspond to the elements in the signal-flow
description. Our two procedures decompose the computations in a different way,
spreading the enumeration over the program and mingling it with the map, the
filter, and the accumulation. If we could organize our programs to make the
signal-flow structure manifest in the procedures we write, this would increase
the conceptual clarity of the resulting code.

#### [Sequence Operations](book-Z-H-4.html#sec_Temp_181)

The key to organizing programs so as to more clearly reflect the signal-flow
structure is to concentrate on the "signals" that flow from one stage in the
process to the next. If we represent these signals as lists, then we can use
list operations to implement the processing at each of the stages. For
instance, we can implement the mapping stages of the signal-flow diagrams
using the `map` procedure from section 2.2.1:

{{ 2.2.3.3.clj }}

Filtering a sequence to select only those elements that satisfy a given
predicate is accomplished by

{{ 2.2.3.4.clj }}

For example,

{{ 2.2.3.5.clj }}

Accumulations can be implemented by

{{ 2.2.3.6.clj }}

All that remains to implement signal-flow diagrams is to enumerate the
sequence of elements to be processed. For `even-fibs`, we need to generate the
sequence of integers in a given range, which we can do as follows:

{{ 2.2.3.7.clj }}

To enumerate the leaves of a tree, we can use[^fn-14]

{{ 2.2.3.8.clj }}

Now we can reformulate `sum-odd-squares` and `even-fibs` as in the signal-flow
diagrams. For `sum-odd-squares`, we enumerate the sequence of leaves of the
tree, filter this to keep only the odd numbers in the sequence, square each
element, and sum the results:

{{ 2.2.3.9.clj }}

For `even-fibs`, we enumerate the integers from 0 to _n_, generate the
Fibonacci number for each of these integers, filter the resulting sequence to
keep only the even elements, and accumulate the results into a list:

{{ 2.2.3.10.clj }}

The value of expressing programs as sequence operations is that this helps us
make program designs that are modular, that is, designs that are constructed
by combining relatively independent pieces. We can encourage modular design by
providing a library of standard components together with a conventional
interface for connecting the components in flexible ways.

Modular construction is a powerful strategy for controlling complexity in
engineering design. In real signal-processing applications, for example,
designers regularly build systems by cascading elements selected from
standardized families of filters and transducers. Similarly, sequence
operations provide a library of standard program elements that we can mix and
match. For instance, we can reuse pieces from the `sum-odd-squares` and `even-
fibs` procedures in a program that constructs a list of the squares of the
first \\( n + 1 \\) Fibonacci numbers:

{{ 2.2.3.11.clj }}

We can rearrange the pieces and use them in computing the product of the odd
integers in a sequence:

{{ 2.2.3.12.clj }}

We can also formulate conventional data-processing applications in terms of
sequence operations. Suppose we have a sequence of personnel records and we
want to find the salary of the highest-paid programmer. Assume that we have a
selector `salary` that returns the salary of a record, and a predicate
`programmer?` that tests if a record is for a programmer. Then we can write

{{ 2.2.3.13.clj }}

These examples give just a hint of the vast range of operations that can be
expressed as sequence operations.[^fn-15]

Sequences, implemented here as lists, serve as a conventional interface that
permits us to combine processing modules. Additionally, when we uniformly
represent structures as sequences, we have localized the data-structure
dependencies in our programs to a small number of sequence operations. By
changing these, we can experiment with alternative representations of
sequences, while leaving the overall design of our programs intact. We will
exploit this capability in section [3.5](24.html#sec_3.5), when we
generalize the sequence-processing paradigm to admit infinite sequences.

**Exercise 2.33.**  Fill in the missing expressions to complete the following 
definitions of some basic list-manipulation operations as accumulations: 

{{ 2.2.3.14.clj }}

**Exercise 2.34.**  Evaluating a polynomial in _x_ at a given value of _x_ can be 
formulated as an accumulation. We evaluate the polynomial 

\\[ a\_{n}x^{n} + a\_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a\_{1}x+a\_{0} \\]

using a well-known algorithm called _Horner's rule_, which structures the
computation as

\\[ (\cdots(a\_{n}x + a\_{n-1)x+\cdots+a\_{1})x+a\_{0} \\]

In other words, we start with \\( a\_{n} \\), multiply by \\( x \\), add
\\( a\_{n-1} \\), multiply by \\( x \\), and so on, until we reach \\(a\_{0}\\).[^fn-16]
Fill in the following template to produce a procedure that evaluates a polynomial using
Horner's rule. Assume that the coefficients of the polynomial are arranged in a sequence,
from \\( a\_{0} \\) through \\( a\_{n} \\).

{{ 2.2.3.15.clj }}

For example, to compute \\( 1 + 3x + 5x^3 + x^5 \\) at \\( x = 2 \\) you would
evaluate

{{ 2.2.3.16.clj }}

**Exercise 2.35.**  Redefine `count-leaves` from section 2.2.2 as an accumulation: 

{{ 2.2.3.17.clj }}

**Exercise 2.36.**  The procedure `accumulate-n` is similar to `accumulate` except that
it takes as its third argument a sequence of sequences, which are all assumed to have
the same number of elements. It applies the designated accumulation procedure to combine
all the first elements of the sequences, all the second elements of the sequences, and
so on, and returns a sequence of the results. For instance, if `s` is a sequence 
containing four sequences, `((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12)),` then the value of
`(accumulate-n + 0 s)` should be the sequence `(22 26 30)`. Fill in the missing
expressions in the following definition of `accumulate-n`: 

{{ 2.2.3.18.clj }}

**Exercise 2.37.**  Suppose we represent vectors \\(v = (v\_i) \\) as sequences of
numbers, and matrices \\(m = (m\_{ij}) \\) as sequences of vectors (the rows of the
matrix). For example, the matrix 

![](ch2-Z-G-20.gif)

is represented as the sequence `((1 2 3 4) (4 5 6 6) (6 7 8 9))`. With this
representation, we can use sequence operations to concisely express the basic
matrix and vector operations. These operations (which are described in any
book on matrix algebra) are the following:

![](ch2-Z-G-21.gif)

We can define the dot product as17

{{ 2.2.3.19.clj }}

Fill in the missing expressions in the following procedures for computing the
other matrix operations. (The procedure `accumulate-n` is defined in exercise
2.36.)

{{ 2.2.3.20.clj }}

**Exercise 2.38.**  The `accumulate` procedure is also known as `fold-right`, because
it combines the first element of the sequence with the result of combining all the
elements to the right. There is also a `fold-left`, which is similar to `fold-right`,
except that it combines elements working in the opposite direction: 

{{ 2.2.3.21.clj }}

What are the values of

{{ 2.2.3.22.clj }}

Give a property that `op` should satisfy to guarantee that `fold-right` and
`fold-left` will produce the same values for any sequence.

**Exercise 2.39.**   Complete the following definitions of `reverse` (exercise 2.18) in 
terms of `fold-right` and `fold-left` from exercise 2.38: 

{{ 2.2.3.23.clj }}

#### [Nested Mappings](4.html#sec_Temp_193)

We can extend the sequence paradigm to include many computations that are
commonly expressed using nested loops.[^fn-18] Consider this problem: Given a
positive integer \\( n \\), find all ordered pairs of distinct positive integers 
\\( i \\) and \\( j \\), where \\( 1 &lt; j &lt;  i &lt; n \\), such that
\\( i+j \\) is prime. For example, if \\( n \\) is 6, then the pairs are the following:

![](ch2-Z-G-22.gif)

A natural way to organize this computation is to generate the sequence of all
ordered pairs of positive integers less than or equal to _n_, filter to select
those pairs whose sum is prime, and then, for each pair \\( (i, j) \\) that passes
through the filter, produce the triple \\( (i,j,i+j) \\).

Here is a way to generate the sequence of pairs: For each integer \\( i &lt;n \\),
enumerate the integers \\( j &lt; i \\), and for each such \\( i \\) and \\( j \\)
generate the pair \\( (i,j) \\). In terms of sequence operations, we map along the
sequence `(enumerate-interval 1 n)`. For each \\( i \\) in this sequence, we map along
the sequence `(enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))`. For each \\( j \\) in this latter
sequence, we generate the pair `(list i j)`. This gives us a sequence of pairs
for each \\( i \\). Combining all the sequences for all the \\( i \\) (by accumulating
with `concat`) produces the required sequence of pairs:[^fn-19]

{{ 2.2.3.24.clj }}

The combination of mapping and accumulating with `concat` is so common in this
sort of program that we will isolate it as a separate procedure:

{{ 2.2.3.25.clj }}

Now filter this sequence of pairs to find those whose sum is prime. The filter
predicate is called for each element of the sequence; its argument is a pair
and it must extract the integers from the pair. Thus, the predicate to apply
to each element in the sequence is

{{ 2.2.3.26.clj }}

Finally, generate the sequence of results by mapping over the filtered pairs
using the following procedure, which constructs a triple consisting of the two
elements of the pair along with their sum:

{{ 2.2.3.27.clj }}

Combining all these steps yields the complete procedure:

{{ 2.2.3.28.clj }}

Nested mappings are also useful for sequences other than those that enumerate
intervals. Suppose we wish to generate all the permutations of a set _S_; that
is, all the ways of ordering the items in the set. For instance, the
permutations of \\( {1,2,3} \\) are \\( {1,2,3}, {1,3,2}, {2,1,3}, {2,3,1}, {3,1,2},\\)
and \\( {3,2,1} \\). Here is a plan for generating the permutations of _S_: For each
item \\( x \\) in _S_, recursively generate the sequence of permutations of 
\\( S-x \\),[^fn-20] and adjoin \\( x \\) to the front of each one. This yields, for
each \\( x \\) in _S_, the sequence of permutations of _S_ that begin with \\( x \\).
Combining these sequences for all \\( x \\) gives all the permutations of _S_:[^fn-21]

{{ 2.2.3.29.clj }}

Notice how this strategy reduces the problem of generating permutations of _S_
to the problem of generating the permutations of sets with fewer elements than
_S_. In the terminal case, we work our way down to the empty list, which
represents a set of no elements. For this, we generate `(list '())`, which is
a sequence with one item, namely the set with no elements. The `remove`
procedure used in `permutations` returns all the items in a given sequence
except for a given item. This can be expressed as a simple filter:

{{ 2.2.3.30.clj }}

**Exercise 2.40.**  Define a procedure `unique-pairs` that, given an integer \\( n \\),
generates the sequence of pairs \\( (i,j) \\) with \\( 1 &lt; j &lt; i &lt; n \\). Use
`unique-pairs` to simplify the definition of `prime-sum-pairs` given above. 

**Exercise 2.41.**  Write a procedure to find all ordered triples of distinct positive
integers _i_, _j_, and _k_ less than or equal to a given integer _n_ that sum to a given
integer _s_. 

**Exercise 2.42.**  

![](ch2-Z-G-23.gif)

**Figure 2.8:**  A solution to the eight-queens puzzle.

The "eight-queens puzzle" asks how to place eight queens on a chessboard so
that no queen is in check from any other (i.e., no two queens are in the same
row, column, or diagonal). One possible solution is shown in figure 2.8. One
way to solve the puzzle is to work across the board, placing a queen in each
column. Once we have placed \\( k-1 \\) queens, we must place the \\( k \\)th
queen in a position where it does not check any of the queens already on the board.
We can formulate this approach recursively: Assume that we have already generated
the sequence of all possible ways to place \\( k-1 \\) queens in the first
\\( k-1 \\) columns of the board. For each of these ways, generate an extended
set of positions by placing a queen in each row of the \\( k \\)th column. Now
filter these, keeping only the positions for which the queen in the \\( k \\)th column
is safe with respect to the other queens. This produces the sequence of all ways
to place \\( k \\) queens in the first \\( k \\) columns. By continuing this process, we
will produce not only one solution, but all solutions to the puzzle.

We implement this solution as a procedure `queens`, which returns a sequence
of all solutions to the problem of placing _n_ queens on an _n_ x _n_
chessboard. `Queens` has an internal procedure `queen-cols` that returns the
sequence of all ways to place queens in the first _k_ columns of the board.

{{ 2.2.3.31.clj }}

In this procedure `rest-of-queens` is a way to place \\(k-1\\) queens in the
first \\(k-1\\) columns, and `new-row` is a proposed row in which to place the
queen for the \\( k \\)th column. Complete the program by implementing the
representation for sets of board positions, including the procedure `adjoin-
position`, which adjoins a new row-column position to a set of positions, and
`empty-board`, which represents an empty set of positions. You must also write
the procedure `safe?`, which determines for a set of positions, whether the
queen in the \\( k \\)th column is safe with respect to the others. (Note that we
need only check whether the new queen is safe -- the other queens are already
guaranteed safe with respect to each other.)

**Exercise 2.43.**  Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing exercise 2.42. 
His `queens` procedure seems to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Louis never does
manage to wait long enough for it to solve even the 6 x 6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu
Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order of the nested mappings
in the `flatmap`, writing it as 

{{ 2.2.3.32.clj }}

Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how long
it will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens puzzle, assuming that
the program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time _T_.

### [2.2.4  Example: A Picture Language](contents.html#sec_2.2.4)

This section presents a simple language for drawing pictures that illustrates
the power of data abstraction and closure, and also exploits higher-order
procedures in an essential way. The language is designed to make it easy to
experiment with patterns such as the ones in figure 2.9, which are composed of
repeated elements that are shifted and scaled.22 In this language, the data
objects being combined are represented as procedures rather than as list
structure. Just as `cons`, which satisfies the closure property, allowed us to
easily build arbitrarily complicated list structure, the operations in this
language, which also satisfy the closure property, allow us to easily build
arbitrarily complicated patterns.

![](ch2-Z-G-24.gif)            ![](ch2-Z-G-25.gif)

**Figure 2.9:**  Designs generated with the picture language.

#### [The picture language](book-Z-H-4.html#sec_Temp_203)

When we began our study of programming in section
[1.1](book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1), we emphasized the importance of describing
a language by focusing on the language's primitives, its means of combination,
and its means of abstraction. We'll follow that framework here.

Part of the elegance of this picture language is that there is only one kind
of element, called a _painter_. A painter draws an image that is shifted and
scaled to fit within a designated parallelogram-shaped frame. For example,
there's a primitive painter we'll call `wave` that makes a crude line drawing,
as shown in figure 2.10. The actual shape of the drawing depends on the frame
-- all four images in figure 2.10 are produced by the same `wave` painter, but
with respect to four different frames. Painters can be more elaborate than
this: The primitive painter called `rogers` paints a picture of MIT's founder,
William Barton Rogers, as shown in figure 2.11.23 The four images in figure
2.11 are drawn with respect to the same four frames as the `wave` images in
figure 2.10.

To combine images, we use various operations that construct new painters from
given painters. For example, the `beside` operation takes two painters and
produces a new, compound painter that draws the first painter's image in the
left half of the frame and the second painter's image in the right half of the
frame. Similarly, `below` takes two painters and produces a compound painter
that draws the first painter's image below the second painter's image. Some
operations transform a single painter to produce a new painter. For example,
`flip-vert` takes a painter and produces a painter that draws its image
upside-down, and `flip-horiz` produces a painter that draws the original
painter's image left-to-right reversed.

![](ch2-Z-G-26.gif)            ![](ch2-Z-G-27.gif)

![](ch2-Z-G-28.gif)            ![](ch2-Z-G-29.gif)

**Figure 2.10:**  Images produced by the `wave` painter, with respect to four different
frames. The frames, shown with dotted lines, are not part of the images.

![](ch2-Z-G-30.gif)            ![](ch2-Z-G-31.gif)

![](ch2-Z-G-32.gif)            ![](ch2-Z-G-33.gif)

**Figure 2.11:**  Images of William Barton Rogers, founder and first president of MIT,
painted with respect to the same four frames as in figure 2.10 (original image reprinted
with the permission of the MIT Museum).

Figure 2.12 shows the drawing of a painter called `wave4` that is built up in
two stages starting from `wave`:

{{ 2.2.4.1.clj }}

![](ch2-Z-G-34.gif)            ![](ch2-Z-G-35.gif)

{{ 2.2.4.2.clj }}

**Figure 2.12:**  Creating a complex figure, starting from the `wave` painter of 
figure 2.10.

In building up a complex image in this manner we are exploiting the fact that
painters are closed under the language's means of combination. The `beside` or
`below` of two painters is itself a painter; therefore, we can use it as an
element in making more complex painters. As with building up list structure
using `cons`, the closure of our data under the means of combination is
crucial to the ability to create complex structures while using only a few
operations.

Once we can combine painters, we would like to be able to abstract typical
patterns of combining painters. We will implement the painter operations as
Scheme procedures. This means that we don't need a special abstraction
mechanism in the picture language: Since the means of combination are ordinary
Scheme procedures, we automatically have the capability to do anything with
painter operations that we can do with procedures. For example, we can
abstract the pattern in `wave4` as

{{ 2.2.4.3.clj }}

and define `wave4` as an instance of this pattern:

{{ 2.2.4.4.clj }}

We can also define recursive operations. Here's one that makes painters split
and branch towards the right as shown in figures 2.13 and  2.14:

{{ 2.2.4.5.clj }}

![](ch2-Z-G-36.gif)           ![](ch2-Z-G-37.gif)

`     right-split _n_                   corner-split _n_  
`

**Figure 2.13:**  Recursive plans for `right-split` and `corner-split`.

We can produce balanced patterns by branching upwards as well as towards the
right (see exercise 2.44 and figures 2.13 and  2.14):

{{ 2.2.4.6.clj }}

![](ch2-Z-G-38.gif)            ![](ch2-Z-G-39.gif)

`     (right-split wave 4)         (right-split rogers 4)  
`

![](ch2-Z-G-40.gif)            ![](ch2-Z-G-41.gif)

`    (corner-split wave 4)         (corner-split rogers 4)  
`

**Figure 2.14:**  The recursive operations `right-split` and `corner-split` applied to
the painters `wave` and `rogers`. Combining four `corner-split` figures produces 
symmetric `square-limit` designs as shown in figure 2.9.

By placing four copies of a `corner-split` appropriately, we obtain a pattern
called `square-limit`, whose application to `wave` and `rogers` is shown in
figure 2.9:

{{ 2.2.4.7.clj }}

**Exercise 2.44.**  Define the procedure `up-split` used by `corner-split`. It is
similar to `right-split`, except that it switches the roles of `below` and `beside`. 

#### [Higher-order operations](book-Z-H-4.html#sec_Temp_206)

In addition to abstracting patterns of combining painters, we can work at a
higher level, abstracting patterns of combining painter operations. That is,
we can view the painter operations as elements to manipulate and can write
means of combination for these elements -- procedures that take painter
operations as arguments and create new painter operations.

For example, `flipped-pairs` and `square-limit` each arrange four copies of a
painter's image in a square pattern; they differ only in how they orient the
copies. One way to abstract this pattern of painter combination is with the
following procedure, which takes four one-argument painter operations and
produces a painter operation that transforms a given painter with those four
operations and arranges the results in a square. `Tl`, `tr`, `bl`, and `br`
are the transformations to apply to the top left copy, the top right copy, the
bottom left copy, and the bottom right copy, respectively.

{{ 2.2.4.8.clj }}

Then `flipped-pairs` can be defined in terms of `square-of-four` as follows:24

{{ 2.2.4.9.clj }}

and `square-limit` can be expressed as25

{{ 2.2.4.10.clj }}

**Exercise 2.45.**  `Right-split` and `up-split` can be expressed as instances of a
general splitting operation. Define a procedure `split` with the property that
evaluating 

{{ 2.2.4.11.clj }}

produces procedures `right-split` and `up-split` with the same behaviors as
the ones already defined.

#### [Frames](book-Z-H-4.html#sec_Temp_210)

Before we can show how to implement painters and their means of combination,
we must first consider frames. A frame can be described by three vectors -- an
origin vector and two edge vectors. The origin vector specifies the offset of
the frame's origin from some absolute origin in the plane, and the edge
vectors specify the offsets of the frame's corners from its origin. If the
edges are perpendicular, the frame will be rectangular. Otherwise the frame
will be a more general parallelogram.

Figure 2.15 shows a frame and its associated vectors. In accordance with data
abstraction, we need not be specific yet about how frames are represented,
other than to say that there is a constructor `make-frame`, which takes three
vectors and produces a frame, and three corresponding selectors `origin-
frame`, `edge1-frame`, and `edge2-frame` (see exercise 2.47).

![](ch2-Z-G-42.gif)

**Figure 2.15:**  A frame is described by three vectors -- an origin and two edges.

We will use coordinates in the unit square \\( (0 \lte x,y \lte 1) \\) to specify
images. With each frame, we associate a _frame coordinate map_, which will be
used to shift and scale images to fit the frame. The map transforms the unit
square into the frame by mapping the vector \\( v = (x,y) \\) to the vector
sum

\\[ Origin(Frame) + x \cdot Edge\_1(Frame) + y \cdot Edge\_2(Frame) \\]

For example, (0,0) is mapped to the origin of the frame, (1,1) to the vertex
diagonally opposite the origin, and (0.5,0.5) to the center of the frame. We
can create a frame's coordinate map with the following procedure:26

{{ 2.2.4.12.clj }}

Observe that applying `frame-coord-map` to a frame returns a procedure that,
given a vector, returns a vector. If the argument vector is in the unit
square, the result vector will be in the frame. For example,

{{ 2.2.4.13.clj }}

returns the same vector as

{{ 2.2.4.14.clj }}

**Exercise 2.46.**  A two-dimensional vector **v** running from the origin to a point
can be represented as a pair consisting of an _x_-coordinate and a _y_-coordinate.
Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a constructor `make-vect` and
corresponding selectors `xcor-vect` and `ycor-vect`. In terms of your selectors and
constructor, implement procedures `add-vect`, `sub-vect`, and `scale-vect` that perform
the operations vector addition, vector subtraction, and multiplying a vector by a 
scalar: 

\\[ (x\_1, y\_1) + (x\_2, y\_2) = (x\_1 + x\_2, y\_1 + y\_2) \\\\
    (x\_1, y\_1) - (x\_2, y\_2) = (x\_1 - x\_2, y\_1 - y\_2) \\\\
                 s \cdot (x, y) = (sx, sy) \\] 

**Exercise 2.47.**  Here are two possible constructors for frames: 

{{ 2.2.4.15.clj }}

For each constructor supply the appropriate selectors to produce an
implementation for frames.

#### [Painters](book-Z-H-4.html#sec_Temp_214)

A painter is represented as a procedure that, given a frame as argument, draws
a particular image shifted and scaled to fit the frame. That is to say, if `p`
is a painter and `f` is a frame, then we produce `p`'s image in `f` by calling
`p` with `f` as argument.

The details of how primitive painters are implemented depend on the particular
characteristics of the graphics system and the type of image to be drawn. For
instance, suppose we have a procedure `draw-line` that draws a line on the
screen between two specified points. Then we can create painters for line
drawings, such as the `wave` painter in figure 2.10, from lists of line
segments as follows:27

{{ 2.2.4.16.clj }}

The segments are given using coordinates with respect to the unit square. For
each segment in the list, the painter transforms the segment endpoints with
the frame coordinate map and draws a line between the transformed points.

Representing painters as procedures erects a powerful abstraction barrier in
the picture language. We can create and intermix all sorts of primitive
painters, based on a variety of graphics capabilities. The details of their
implementation do not matter. Any procedure can serve as a painter, provided
that it takes a frame as argument and draws something scaled to fit the
frame.28

**Exercise 2.48.**  A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair
of vectors -- the vector running from the origin to the start-point of the segment, 
and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of the segment. Use your vector
representation from exercise 2.46 to define a representation for segments with a
constructor `make-segment` and selectors `start-segment` and `end-segment`. 

**Exercise 2.49.**  Use `segments->painter` to define the following primitive painters:

-a.  The painter that draws the outline of the designated frame.

-b.  The painter that draws an "X" by connecting opposite corners of the
frame.

-c.  The painter that draws a diamond shape by connecting the midpoints of the
sides of the frame.

-d.  The `wave` painter.

#### [Transforming and combining painters](book-Z-H-4.html#sec_Temp_219)

An operation on painters (such as `flip-vert` or `beside`) works by creating a
painter that invokes the original painters with respect to frames derived from
the argument frame. Thus, for example, `flip-vert` doesn't have to know how a
painter works in order to flip it -- it just has to know how to turn a frame
upside down: The flipped painter just uses the original painter, but in the
inverted frame.

Painter operations are based on the procedure `transform-painter`, which takes
as arguments a painter and information on how to transform a frame and
produces a new painter. The transformed painter, when called on a frame,
transforms the frame and calls the original painter on the transformed frame.
The arguments to `transform-painter` are points (represented as vectors) that
specify the corners of the new frame: When mapped into the frame, the first
point specifies the new frame's origin and the other two specify the ends of
its edge vectors. Thus, arguments within the unit square specify a frame
contained within the original frame.

{{ 2.2.4.17.clj }}

Here's how to flip painter images vertically:

{{ 2.2.4.18.clj }}

Using `transform-painter`, we can easily define new transformations. For
example, we can define a painter that shrinks its image to the upper-right
quarter of the frame it is given:

{{ 2.2.4.19.clj }}

Other transformations rotate images counterclockwise by 90 degrees29

{{ 2.2.4.20.clj }}

or squash images towards the center of the frame:30

{{ 2.2.4.21.clj }}

Frame transformation is also the key to defining means of combining two or
more painters. The `beside` procedure, for example, takes two painters,
transforms them to paint in the left and right halves of an argument frame
respectively, and produces a new, compound painter. When the compound painter
is given a frame, it calls the first transformed painter to paint in the left
half of the frame and calls the second transformed painter to paint in the
right half of the frame:
 
{{ 2.2.4.22.clj }}

Observe how the painter data abstraction, and in particular the representation
of painters as procedures, makes `beside` easy to implement. The `beside`
procedure need not know anything about the details of the component painters
other than that each painter will draw something in its designated frame.

**Exercise 2.50.**  Define the transformation `flip-horiz`, which flips painters
horizontally, and transformations that rotate painters counterclockwise by 180
degrees and 270 degrees. 

**Exercise 2.51.**  Define the `below` operation for painters. `Below` takes two
painters as arguments. The resulting painter, given a frame, draws with the first
painter in the bottom of the frame and with the second painter in the top. Define
`below` in two different ways -- first by writing a procedure that is analogous to
the `beside` procedure given above, and again in terms of `beside` and suitable
rotation operations (from exercise 2.50). 

#### [Levels of language for robust design](book-Z-H-4.html#sec_Temp_224)

The picture language exercises some of the critical ideas we've introduced
about abstraction with procedures and data. The fundamental data abstractions,
painters, are implemented using procedural representations, which enables the
language to handle different basic drawing capabilities in a uniform way. The
means of combination satisfy the closure property, which permits us to easily
build up complex designs. Finally, all the tools for abstracting procedures
are available to us for abstracting means of combination for painters.

We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea about languages and
program design. This is the approach of _stratified design_, the notion that a
complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described
using a sequence of languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts
that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at
each level are used as primitives at the next level. The language used at each
level of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means
of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.

Stratified design pervades the engineering of complex systems. For example, in
computer engineering, resistors and transistors are combined (and described
using a language of analog circuits) to produce parts such as and-gates and
or-gates, which form the primitives of a language for digital-circuit
design.31 These parts are combined to build processors, bus structures, and
memory systems, which are in turn combined to form computers, using languages
appropriate to computer architecture. Computers are combined to form
distributed systems, using languages appropriate for describing network
interconnections, and so on.

As a tiny example of stratification, our picture language uses primitive
elements (primitive painters) that are created using a language that specifies
points and lines to provide the lists of line segments for
`segments->painter`, or the shading details for a painter like `rogers`. The
bulk of our description of the picture language focused on combining these
primitives, using geometric combiners such as `beside` and `below`. We also
worked at a higher level, regarding `beside` and `below` as primitives to be
manipulated in a language whose operations, such as `square-of-four`, capture
common patterns of combining geometric combiners.

Stratified design helps make programs _robust_, that is, it makes it likely
that small changes in a specification will require correspondingly small
changes in the program. For instance, suppose we wanted to change the image
based on `wave` shown in figure 2.9. We could work at the lowest level to
change the detailed appearance of the `wave` element; we could work at the
middle level to change the way `corner-split` replicates the `wave`; we could
work at the highest level to change how `square-limit` arranges the four
copies of the corner. In general, each level of a stratified design provides a
different vocabulary for expressing the characteristics of the system, and a
different kind of ability to change it.

**Exercise 2.52.**  Make changes to the square limit of `wave` shown in figure 2.9
by working at each of the levels described above. In particular:

a.  Add some segments to the primitive `wave` painter of exercise  2.49 (to
add a smile, for example).

b.  Change the pattern constructed by `corner-split` (for example, by using
only one copy of the `up-split` and `right-split` images instead of two).

c.  Modify the version of `square-limit` that uses `square-of-four` so as to
assemble the corners in a different pattern. (For example, you might make the
big Mr. Rogers look outward from each corner of the square.)

* * *

[fn-6] The use of the word "closure" here comes from abstract algebra, where a
set of elements is said to be closed under an operation if applying the
operation to elements in the set produces an element that is again an element
of the set. The Lisp community also (unfortunately) uses the word "closure"
to describe a totally unrelated concept: A closure is an implementation
technique for representing procedures with free variables. We do not use the
word "closure" in this second sense in this book.

[fn-7] The notion that a means of combination should satisfy closure is a
straightforward idea. Unfortunately, the data combiners provided in many
popular programming languages do not satisfy closure, or make closure
cumbersome to exploit. In Fortran or Basic, one typically combines data
elements by assembling them into arrays -- but one cannot form arrays whose
elements are themselves arrays. Pascal and C admit structures whose elements
are structures. However, this requires that the programmer manipulate pointers
explicitly, and adhere to the restriction that each field of a structure can
contain only elements of a prespecified form. Unlike Lisp with its pairs,
these languages have no built-in general-purpose glue that makes it easy to
manipulate compound data in a uniform way. This limitation lies behind Alan
Perlis's comment in his foreword to this book: "In Pascal the plethora of
declarable data structures induces a specialization within functions that
inhibits and penalizes casual cooperation. It is better to have 100 functions
operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data
structures."

[fn-8] In this book, we use _list_ to mean a chain of pairs terminated by the end-
of-list marker. In contrast, the term _list structure_ refers to any data
structure made out of pairs, not just to lists.

[fn-9] Since nested applications of `car` and `cdr` are cumbersome to write, Lisp
dialects provide abbreviations for them -- for instance,

![](ch2-Z-G-14.gif)

The names of all such procedures start with `c` and end with `r`. Each `a`
between them stands for a `car` operation and each `d` for a `cdr` operation,
to be applied in the same order in which they appear in the name. The names
`car` and `cdr` persist because simple combinations like `cadr` are
pronounceable.

[fn-10] It's remarkable how much energy in the standardization of Lisp dialects has
been dissipated in arguments that are literally over nothing: Should `nil` be
an ordinary name? Should the value of `nil` be a symbol? Should it be a list?
Should it be a pair? In Scheme, `nil` is an ordinary name, which we use in
this section as a variable whose value is the end-of-list marker (just as
`true` is an ordinary variable that has a true value). Other dialects of Lisp,
including Common Lisp, treat `nil` as a special symbol. The authors of this
book, who have endured too many language standardization brawls, would like to
avoid the entire issue. Once we have introduced quotation in section
[2.3](16.html#sec_2.3), we will denote the empty list as `'()` and
dispense with the variable `nil` entirely.

[fn-11] To define `f` and `g` using `lambda` we would write

`(define f (lambda (x y . z) <_body_>))  
(define g (lambda w <_body_>))  
`

[fn-12] Scheme standardly provides a `map` procedure that is more general than the
one described here. This more general `map` takes a procedure of _n_
arguments, together with _n_ lists, and applies the procedure to all the first
elements of the lists, all the second elements of the lists, and so on,
returning a list of the results. For example:

`(map + (list 1 2 3) (list 40 50 60) (list 700 800 900))  
_(741 852 963)_  
  
(map (lambda (x y) (+ x (* 2 y)))  
     (list 1 2 3)  
     (list 4 5 6))  
_(9 12 15)_  
`

[fn-13] The order of the first two clauses in the `cond` matters, since the empty
list satisfies `null?` and also is not a pair.

[fn-14] This is, in fact, precisely the `fringe` procedure from exercise 2.28. Here
we've renamed it to emphasize that it is part of a family of general sequence-
manipulation procedures.

[fn-15] Richard Waters (1979) developed a program that automatically analyzes
traditional Fortran programs, viewing them in terms of maps, filters, and
accumulations. He found that fully 90 percent of the code in the Fortran
Scientific Subroutine Package fits neatly into this paradigm. One of the
reasons for the success of Lisp as a programming language is that lists
provide a standard medium for expressing ordered collections so that they can
be manipulated using higher-order operations. The programming language APL
owes much of its power and appeal to a similar choice. In APL all data are
represented as arrays, and there is a universal and convenient set of generic
operators for all sorts of array operations.

[fn-16] According to Knuth (1981), this rule was formulated by W. G. Horner early
in the nineteenth century, but the method was actually used by Newton over a
hundred years earlier. Horner's rule evaluates the polynomial using fewer
additions and multiplications than does the straightforward method of first
computing _a__n_ _x__n_, then adding _a__n_-1_x__n_-1, and so on. In fact, it
is possible to prove that any algorithm for evaluating arbitrary polynomials
must use at least as many additions and multiplications as does Horner's rule,
and thus Horner's rule is an optimal algorithm for polynomial evaluation. This
was proved (for the number of additions) by A. M. Ostrowski in a 1954 paper
that essentially founded the modern study of optimal algorithms. The analogous
statement for multiplications was proved by V. Y. Pan in 1966. The book by
Borodin and Munro (1975) provides an overview of these and other results about
optimal algorithms.

[fn-17] This definition uses the extended version of `map` described in footnote
12.

[fn-18] This approach to nested mappings was shown to us by David Turner, whose
languages KRC and Miranda provide elegant formalisms for dealing with these
constructs. The examples in this section (see also exercise 2.42) are adapted
from Turner 1981\. In section [3.5.3](book-Z-H-24.html#%_sec_3.5.3), we'll see
how this approach generalizes to infinite sequences.

[fn-19] We're representing a pair here as a list of two elements rather than as a
Lisp pair. Thus, the "pair" (_i_,_j_) is represented as `(list i j)`, not
`(cons i j)`.

[fn-20] The set _S_ \- _x_ is the set of all elements of _S_, excluding _x_.

[fn-21] Semicolons in Scheme code are used to introduce _comments_. Everything from
the semicolon to the end of the line is ignored by the interpreter. In this
book we don't use many comments; we try to make our programs self-documenting
by using descriptive names.

[fn-22] The picture language is based on the language Peter Henderson created to
construct images like M.C. Escher's "Square Limit" woodcut (see Henderson
1982). The woodcut incorporates a repeated scaled pattern, similar to the
arrangements drawn using the `square-limit` procedure in this section.

[fn-23] William Barton Rogers (1804-1882) was the founder and first president of
MIT. A geologist and talented teacher, he taught at William and Mary College
and at the University of Virginia. In 1859 he moved to Boston, where he had
more time for research, worked on a plan for establishing a "polytechnic
institute," and served as Massachusetts's first State Inspector of Gas
Meters.

When MIT was established in 1861, Rogers was elected its first president.
Rogers espoused an ideal of "useful learning" that was different from the
university education of the time, with its overemphasis on the classics,
which, as he wrote, "stand in the way of the broader, higher and more
practical instruction and discipline of the natural and social sciences."
This education was likewise to be different from narrow trade-school
education. In Rogers's words:

> The world-enforced distinction between the practical and the scientific
worker is utterly futile, and the whole experience of modern times has
demonstrated its utter worthlessness.

Rogers served as president of MIT until 1870, when he resigned due to ill
health. In 1878 the second president of MIT, John Runkle, resigned under the
pressure of a financial crisis brought on by the Panic of 1873 and strain of
fighting off attempts by Harvard to take over MIT. Rogers returned to hold the
office of president until 1881.

Rogers collapsed and died while addressing MIT's graduating class at the
commencement exercises of 1882. Runkle quoted Rogers's last words in a
memorial address delivered that same year:

> "As I stand here today and see what the Institute is, ...I call to mind
the beginnings of science. I remember one hundred and fifty years ago Stephen
Hales published a pamphlet on the subject of illuminating gas, in which he
stated that his researches had demonstrated that 128 grains of bituminous coal&mdash;"

> "Bituminous coal," these were his last words on earth. Here he bent
forward, as if consulting some notes on the table before him, then slowly
regaining an erect position, threw up his hands, and was translated from the
scene of his earthly labors and triumphs to "the tomorrow of death," where
the mysteries of life are solved, and the disembodied spirit finds unending
satisfaction in contemplating the new and still unfathomable mysteries of the
infinite future.

In the words of Francis A. Walker (MIT's third president):

> All his life he had borne himself most faithfully and heroically, and he
died as so good a knight would surely have wished, in harness, at his post,
and in the very part and act of public duty.

[fn-24] Equivalently, we could write

`(define flipped-pairs  
  (square-of-four identity flip-vert identity flip-vert))  
`

[fn-25] `Rotate180` rotates a painter by 180 degrees (see exercise 2.50). Instead
of `rotate180` we could say `(compose flip-vert flip-horiz)`, using the
`compose` procedure from exercise [1.42](12.html#thm_1.42).

[fn-26] `Frame-coord-map` uses the vector operations described in exercise 2.46
below, which we assume have been implemented using some representation for
vectors. Because of data abstraction, it doesn't matter what this vector
representation is, so long as the vector operations behave correctly.

[fn-27] `Segments-&gt;painter` uses the representation for line segments described in
exercise 2.48 below. It also uses the `for-each` procedure described in
exercise 2.23.

[fn-28] For example, the `rogers` painter of figure 2.11 was constructed from a
gray-level image. For each point in a given frame, the `rogers` painter
determines the point in the image that is mapped to it under the frame
coordinate map, and shades it accordingly. By allowing different types of
painters, we are capitalizing on the abstract data idea discussed in section
[2.1.3](14.html#sec_2.1.3), where we argued that a rational-number
representation could be anything at all that satisfies an appropriate
condition. Here we're using the fact that a painter can be implemented in any
way at all, so long as it draws something in the designated frame. Section
[2.1.3](14.html#sec_2.1.3) also showed how pairs could be
implemented as procedures. Painters are our second example of a procedural
representation for data.

[fn-29] `Rotate90` is a pure rotation only for square frames, because it also
stretches and shrinks the image to fit into the rotated frame.

[fn-30] The diamond-shaped images in figures 2.10 and 2.11 were created with
`squash-inwards` applied to `wave` and `rogers`.

[fn-31] Section [3.3.4](22.html#%_sec_3.3.4) describes one such language.
