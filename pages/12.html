This would place us at a serious disadvantage, forcing us to work always at the level of the particular operations that happen to be primitives in the language (multiplication, in this case) rather than in terms of higher-level operations. Our programs would be able to compute cubes, but our language would lack the ability to express the concept of cubing. One of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common patterns and then to work in terms of the abstractions directly. Procedures provide this ability. This is why all but the most primitive programming languages include mechanisms for defining procedures.</p><p>Yet even in numerical processing we will be severely limited in our ability to create abstractions if we are restricted to procedures whose parameters must be numbers. Often the same programming pattern will be used with a number of different procedures. To express such patterns as concepts, we will need to construct procedures that can accept procedures as arguments or return procedures as values. Procedures that manipulate procedures are called <em>higher-order procedures</em>. This section shows how higher-order procedures can serve as powerful abstraction mechanisms, vastly increasing the expressive power of our language.</p><h3 id="sec_1.3.1"><a href="contents.html#sec_1.3.1">1.3.1 Procedures as Arguments</a></h3><p>Consider the following three procedures.

They are for the most part identical, differing only in the name of the procedure, the function of <code>a</code> used to compute the term to be added, and the function that provides the next value of <code>a</code>.

Indeed, mathematicians long ago identified the abstraction of <em>summation of a series</em> and invented &quot;sigma notation,&quot; for example</p><p>\[ \sum_{n=a}^{b} f(n) = f(a) + \dotsb + f(b) \]</p><p>to express this concept. The power of sigma notation is that it allows mathematicians to deal with the concept of summation itself rather than only with particular sums -- for example, to formulate general results about sums that are independent of the particular series being summed.</p><p>Similarly, as program designers, we would like our language to be powerful enough so that we can write a procedure that expresses the concept of summation itself rather than only procedures that compute particular sums. We can do so readily in our procedural language by taking the common template shown above and transforming the &quot;slots&quot; into formal parameters:</p>

With higher-order procedures, such as the <code>integral</code> procedure of section 1.3.1, we began to see a more powerful kind of abstraction: procedures used to express general methods of computation, independent of the particular functions involved. In this section we discuss two more elaborate examples -- general methods for finding zeros and fixed points of functions -- and show how these methods can be expressed directly as procedures.</p><h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#sec_Temp_103">Finding roots of equations by the half-interval method</a></h4><p>The <em>half-interval method</em> is a simple but powerful technique for finding roots of an equation \( f(x)=0 \), where <em>f</em> is a continuous function. The idea is that, if we are given points <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> such that \( f(a) &lt; 0 &lt; f(b) \), then <em>f</em> must have at least one zero between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. To locate a zero, let <em>x</em> be the average of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> and compute \( f(x) \). If \( f(x) &gt; 0 \), then <em>f</em> must have a zero between <em>a</em> and <em>x</em>. If \( f(x) &lt; 0 \), then <em>f</em> must have a zero between <em>x</em> and <em>b</em>. Continuing in this way, we can identify smaller and smaller intervals on which <em>f</em> must have a zero. When we reach a point where the interval is small enough, the process stops. Since the interval of uncertainty is reduced by half at each step of the process, the number of steps required grows as \( \Theta(\log(L/T)) \), where <em>L</em> is the length of the original interval and <em>T</em> is the error tolerance (that is, the size of the interval we will consider &quot;small enough&quot;). Here is a procedure that implements this strategy:</p>

We first compute the midpoint of the two given points. Next we check to see if the given interval is small enough, and if so we simply return the midpoint as our answer. Otherwise, we compute as a test value the value of <em>f</em> at the midpoint. If the test value is positive, then we continue the process with a new interval running from the original negative point to the midpoint. If the test value is negative, we continue with the interval from the midpoint to the positive point. Finally, there is the possibility that the test value is 0, in which case the midpoint is itself the root we are searching for.</p><p>To test whether the endpoints are &quot;close enough&quot; we can use a procedure similar to the one used in section <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.7">1.1.7</a> for computing square roots:55</p>

For instance, the derivative of the function \( x \mapsto x^{3} \) is the function \( x \mapsto 3x^{2} \). In general, if <em>g</em> is a function and <em>dx</em> is a small number, then the derivative <em>Dg</em> of <em>g</em> is the function whose value at any number <em>x</em> is given (in the limit of small <em>dx</em>) by</p><p>\[ Dg(x) = \frac{g(x+dx)-g(x)}{dx} \]</p><p>Thus, we can express the idea of derivative (taking <em>dx</em> to be, say, 0.00001) as the procedure</p>

Since Newton's method was itself expressed as a fixed-point process, we actually saw two ways to compute square roots as fixed points. Each method begins with a function and finds a fixed point of some transformation of the function. We can express this general idea itself as a procedure:</p>

Now we've seen how higher-order procedures permit us to manipulate these general methods to create further abstractions.</p><p>As programmers, we should be alert to opportunities to identify the underlying abstractions in our programs and to build upon them and generalize them to create more powerful abstractions. This is not to say that one should always write programs in the most abstract way possible; expert programmers know how to choose the level of abstraction appropriate to their task. But it is important to be able to think in terms of these abstractions, so that we can be ready to apply them in new contexts. The significance of higher-order procedures is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements.</p><p>In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have <em>first-class</em> status. Some of the &quot;rights and privileges&quot; of first-class elements are:64</p>

  <li>They may be returned as the results of procedures.</li>

If <em>f</em> is a function and <em>dx</em> is some small number, then the smoothed version of <em>f</em> is the function whose value at a point <em>x</em> is the average of \( f(x-dx) \), \( f(x) \), and \(f(x+dx)\). Write a procedure <code>smooth</code> that takes as input a procedure that computes <em>f</em> and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed <em>f</em>. It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtained the <em>n-fold smoothed function</em>. Show how to generate the <em>n</em>-fold smoothed function of any given function using <code>smooth</code> and <code>repeated</code> from exercise 1.43. </p><p><strong>Exercise 1.45.</strong> We saw in section 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots by naively finding a fixed point of \( y \mapsto x/y \) does not converge, and that this can be fixed by average damping. The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of the average-damped \( y \mapsto x/y^{2} \). Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth roots -- a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point search for \( y \mapsto x/y^{3} \) converge. On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of \( y \mapsto x/y^{3}\)) the fixed-point search does converge. Do some experiments to determine how many average damps are required to compute _n_th roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping of \( y \mapsto x/y^{n-1} \). Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing _n_th roots using <code>fixed-point</code>, <code>average-damp</code>, and the <code>repeated</code> procedure of exercise 1.43. Assume that any arithmetic operations you need are available as primitives. </p><p><strong>Exercise 1.46.</strong> Several of the numerical methods described in this chapter are instances of an extremely general computational strategy known as <em>iterative improvement</em>. Iterative improvement says that, to compute something, we start with an initial guess for the answer, test if the guess is good enough, and otherwise improve the guess and continue the process using the improved guess as the new guess. Write a procedure <code>iterative-improve</code> that takes two procedures as arguments: a method for telling whether a guess is good enough and a method for improving a guess. <code>Iterative-improve</code> should return as its value a procedure that takes a guess as argument and keeps improving the guess until it is good enough. Rewrite the <code>sqrt</code> procedure of section <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.7">1.1.7</a> and the <code>fixed-point</code> procedure of section 1.3.3 in terms of <code>iterative-improve</code>. </p>
<hr><p>49 This series, usually written in the equivalent form (![](book-Z-G-D-9.gif)/4) = 1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + <code>***</code>, is due to Leibniz. We'll see how to use this as the basis for some fancy numerical tricks in section <a href="book-Z-H-24.html#%_sec_3.5.3">3.5.3</a>.</p><p>50 Notice that we have used block structure (section <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.8">1.1.8</a>) to embed the definitions of <code>pi-next</code> and <code>pi-term</code> within <code>pi-sum</code>, since these procedures are unlikely to be useful for any other purpose. We will see how to get rid of them altogether in section 1.3.2.</p><p>51 The intent of exercises 1.31-1.33 is to demonstrate the expressive power that is attained by using an appropriate abstraction to consolidate many seemingly disparate operations. However, though accumulation and filtering are elegant ideas, our hands are somewhat tied in using them at this point since we do not yet have data structures to provide suitable means of combination for these abstractions. We will return to these ideas in section <a href="book-Z-H-15.html#%_sec_2.2.3">2.2.3</a> when we show how to use <em>sequences</em> as interfaces for combining filters and accumulators to build even more powerful abstractions. We will see there how these methods really come into their own as a powerful and elegant approach to designing programs.</p><p>52 This formula was discovered by the seventeenth-century English mathematician John Wallis.</p><p>53 It would be clearer and less intimidating to people learning Lisp if a name more obvious than <code>lambda</code>, such as <code>make-procedure</code>, were used. But the convention is firmly entrenched. The notation is adopted from the ![](book-Z-G-D-6.gif) calculus, a mathematical formalism introduced by the mathematical logician Alonzo Church (1941). Church developed the ![](book-Z-G-D-6.gif) calculus to provide a rigorous foundation for studying the notions of function and function application. The ![](book-Z-G-D-6.gif) calculus has become a basic tool for mathematical investigations of the semantics of programming languages.</p><p>54 Understanding internal definitions well enough to be sure a program means what we intend it to mean requires a more elaborate model of the evaluation process than we have presented in this chapter. The subtleties do not arise with internal definitions of procedures, however. We will return to this issue in section <a href="book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1.6">4.1.6</a>, after we learn more about evaluation.</p><p>55 We have used 0.001 as a representative &quot;small&quot; number to indicate a tolerance for the acceptable error in a calculation. The appropriate tolerance for a real calculation depends upon the problem to be solved and the limitations of the computer and the algorithm. This is often a very subtle consideration, requiring help from a numerical analyst or some other kind of magician.</p><p>56 This can be accomplished using <code>error</code>, which takes as arguments a number of items that are printed as error messages.</p><p>57 Try this during a boring lecture: Set your calculator to radians mode and then repeatedly press the <code>cos</code> button until you obtain the fixed point.</p><p>58 ![](book-Z-G-D-17.gif) (pronounced &quot;maps to&quot;) is the mathematician's way of writing <code>lambda</code>. <em>y</em> ![](book-Z-G-D-17.gif) <em>x</em>/<em>y</em> means <code>(lambda(y) (/ x
y))</code>, that is, the function whose value at <em>y</em> is <em>x</em>/<em>y</em>.</p><p>59 Observe that this is a combination whose operator is itself a combination. Exercise <a href="book-Z-H-10.html#%_thm_1.4">1.4</a> already demonstrated the ability to form such combinations, but that was only a toy example. Here we begin to see the real need for such combinations -- when applying a procedure that is obtained as the value returned by a higher-order procedure.</p><p>60 See exercise 1.45 for a further generalization.</p><p>61 Elementary calculus books usually describe Newton's method in terms of the sequence of approximations <em>x</em><em>n</em>+1 = <em>x</em><em>n</em> - <em>g</em>(<em>x</em><em>n</em>)/<em>D</em><em>g</em>(<em>x</em><em>n</em>). Having language for talking about processes and using the idea of fixed points simplifies the description of the method.</p><p>62 Newton's method does not always converge to an answer, but it can be shown that in favorable cases each iteration doubles the number-of-digits accuracy of the approximation to the solution. In such cases, Newton's method will converge much more rapidly than the half-interval method.</p><p>63 For finding square roots, Newton's method converges rapidly to the correct solution from any starting point.</p><p>64 The notion of first-class status of programming-language elements is due to the British computer scientist Christopher Strachey (1916-1975).</p><p>65 We'll see examples of this after we introduce data structures in chapter 2.</p><p>66 The major implementation cost of first-class procedures is that allowing procedures to be returned as values requires reserving storage for a procedure's free variables even while the procedure is not executing. In the Scheme implementation we will study in section <a href="book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1">4.1</a>, these variables are stored in the procedure's environment.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
